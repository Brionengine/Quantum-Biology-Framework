# 📄 README for ⚛️ Quantum Biology Framework

## 📝 Overview
The **Quantum Biology Framework** is an advanced toolkit designed to revolutionize drug discovery and development. By leveraging quantum computing, AI-driven simulations, and workflow automation, this framework reduces costs and accelerates processes from discovery to market.

## 🔑 Key Modules
1. **Quantum Drug Discovery**:
   - Utilizes quantum algorithms to identify and optimize potential drug compounds with unparalleled speed and accuracy.
   - Simulates molecular interactions to predict optimal candidates.

2. **AI Clinical Trial Simulation**:
   - Simulates virtual patient responses, reducing dependency on costly and time-consuming physical trials.
   - Predicts drug effectiveness, adverse reactions, and dosage optimization using AI.

3. **Automated FDA Workflow**:
   - Tracks and automates documentation for FDA approval.
   - Predicts bottlenecks and optimizes workflows for streamlined submissions.

4. **End-to-End Integration**:
   - Combines drug discovery, clinical trials, and regulatory processes into a cohesive workflow.
   - Provides seamless execution from discovery to market readiness.

## ℹ️ How to Use
1. **📋 Requirements**:
   - Python 3.8+
   - Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

2. **⚙️ Setup**:
   - Install dependencies using:
     ```sh
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
