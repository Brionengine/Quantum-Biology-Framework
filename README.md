# 📄 README for ⚛️ Evolution Framework

## 📝 Overview
The ⚛️ Evolution Framework is an advanced toolkit designed to explore evolutionary algorithms enhanced by quantum computing principles. This framework combines the strengths of classical evolutionary strategies with quantum-inspired enhancements to achieve significant improvements in solving optimization and reinforcement learning problems.

## 🔑 Key Components
- **`quantum_enhanced_ea.py`**: Implements evolutionary algorithms enhanced by quantum mechanisms to optimize fitness functions.
- **`quantum_rl_es.py`**: Uses quantum-enhanced reinforcement learning strategies with evolutionary search to solve problems more efficiently.
- **`quantum_meta_ga.py`**: Applies a quantum-inspired meta-heuristic to a genetic algorithm for finding optimal parameters.
- **`quantum_sim_env.py`**: Provides a quantum simulation environment to test the behavior of the algorithms in controlled scenarios.

## ℹ️ How to Use
1. **📋 Requirements**: Ensure Python 3.8+ and required dependencies are installed.
2. **⚙️ Setup**: Install dependencies using:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **▶️ Execution**: Run the scripts to explore various quantum-enhanced algorithms and analyze the results.
4. **🔧 Customization**: Modify the parameters in the provided Python scripts to adapt the framework to your specific problem set.

## 📝 Note
