# Quantum Evolution Acceleration Framework - Documentation

## Overview
The Quantum Evolution Acceleration Framework is a powerful, quantum-inspired toolkit designed to accelerate adaptive evolution processes in AI and machine learning models. 
The framework leverages quantum-inspired algorithms and methodologies to explore large solution spaces, improve selection processes, and simulate complex adaptive environments.

## Modules

### 1. Quantum-Enhanced Evolutionary Algorithm (QEA)
   - **Purpose**: This module implements an evolutionary algorithm that uses quantum-inspired probabilistic selection and mutation techniques.
   - **Usage**:
     ```python
     from quantum_enhanced_ea import QuantumEnhancedEvolutionaryAlgorithm
     qea = QuantumEnhancedEvolutionaryAlgorithm(population_size=100, num_generations=50)
     evolved_population = qea.evolve()
     ```
   - **Key Functions**:
     - `initialize_population()`: Initializes the population with random values.
     - `quantum_selection()`: Simulates a quantum-inspired selection of the best candidates.

### 2. Quantum Reinforcement Learning with Evolutionary Strategies (QRL-ES)
   - **Purpose**: Integrates reinforcement learning with quantum-inspired exploration techniques to accelerate learning in large search spaces.
   - **Usage**:
     ```python
     from quantum_rl_es import QuantumReinforcementLearningES
     qrl_es = QuantumReinforcementLearningES(num_actions=5, num_states=10)
     action = qrl_es.choose_action(state=3)
     qrl_es.update_q_values(state=3, action=action, reward=1, next_state=4)
     ```
   - **Key Functions**:
     - `choose_action(state)`: Chooses an action with quantum-inspired exploration.
     - `update_q_values(state, action, reward, next_state)`: Updates Q-values with reinforcement learning principles.

### 3. Quantum-Assisted Meta-Genetic Algorithms (QAMGA)
   - **Purpose**: Optimizes evolutionary parameters such as mutation rates and crossover intensities using quantum-inspired noise for self-adjusting algorithms.
   - **Usage**:
     ```python
     from quantum_meta_ga import QuantumMetaGeneticAlgorithm
     qamga = QuantumMetaGeneticAlgorithm(num_parameters=10)
     optimized_parameters = qamga.optimize_parameters()
     ```
   - **Key Functions**:
     - `optimize_parameters()`: Uses a quantum annealing-inspired method to adjust evolutionary parameters.

### 4. Quantum Simulation of Evolutionary Environments
   - **Purpose**: Creates high-fidelity, adaptable environments where agent interactions are driven by quantum randomness, modeling complex evolutionary landscapes.
   - **Usage**:
     ```python
     from quantum_sim_env import QuantumEvolutionaryEnvironment
     qenv = QuantumEvolutionaryEnvironment(num_agents=50)
     environment_state = qenv.simulate_interaction()
     ```
   - **Key Functions**:
     - `simulate_interaction()`: Simulates interaction with quantum randomness to create an evolving environment.

## Setup and Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Install necessary dependencies using pip:
   ```
   pip install numpy
   ```
3. Import the desired module(s) and instantiate the class with required parameters.

## Example Usage
Hereâ€™s a sample script to run the Quantum-Enhanced Evolutionary Algorithm:

```python
from quantum_enhanced_ea import QuantumEnhancedEvolutionaryAlgorithm

# Initialize the algorithm with a population size of 100 and 50 generations
qea = QuantumEnhancedEvolutionaryAlgorithm(population_size=100, num_generations=50)
# Run the evolutionary process
evolved_population = qea.evolve()
print("Evolved Population:", evolved_population)
```

## Troubleshooting and Additional Notes

- **Parameter Tuning**: Adjust parameters such as `population_size`, `num_generations`, and `learning_rate` in each module for optimal performance in your specific use case.
- **Compatibility**: The framework is designed to be modular and adaptable to a variety of machine learning and simulation tasks.
- **Further Development**: Consider integrating quantum processing units (QPUs) for real quantum computations if available.
